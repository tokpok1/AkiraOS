## [1.4.9] — "Gl1tch" — 2026-03-21

> **Release branch:** `v1.4.x` | **PR:** [#52](https://github.com/ArturR0k3r/AkiraOS/pull/52)

This release completes the v1.4.x generation of AkiraOS. It replaces the legacy OCRE runtime with WAMR, introduces the Capability Guard security model, brings up the AkiraConsole custom board, adds a full suite of WASM peripheral APIs, and ships the AkiraSDK as an independently versioned git submodule.

### Runtime Engine

#### Added
- **WAMR integration** — complete migration from OCRE to WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) with Zephyr 4.3.0 compatibility and `native_sim` support
- **Thread-per-app model** — each WASM app runs in its own Zephyr thread; lifecycle managed via `SYS_INIT` hooks
- **AOT support** enabled by default — native-level execution speed with ~60 KB RAM savings over interpreter mode
- **Chunked WASM loading** with automatic PSRAM fallback on ESP32-S3; prevents boot-time OOM
- **Instance pool** — pre-allocated memory slots avoid repeated `malloc`/`free` cycles during app churn
- **Module cache** — SHA-256-keyed hash map skips redundant reloads of identical WASM binaries
- **Execution watchdog** — per-slot configurable timeout terminates runaway apps automatically
- **Per-app memory quotas** enforced inline at `NativeSymbol` dispatch layer
- **Inline capability checks** — `AKIRA_CAP_*` bitmask validated before every native export call
- `wamr_config.h` — central WAMR compile-time configuration header
- `runtime_cache.h` — module cache and hash-map slot-lookup types

#### Changed
- WASM compile target switched from **WASI** to bare **`wasm32`** with self-contained `printf`; eliminates WASI libc dependency in all SDK apps
- `akira_runtime.c` fully rewritten — removed all legacy OCRE glue, magic numbers, and duplicate loader paths
- Settings manager reworked to flash-backed persistence; WiFi credentials now pulled from settings at runtime

#### Fixed
- WASM out-of-bounds memory trap on ESP32-S3 during certain API calls
- App lifecycle freezes when stopping and restarting the same WASM module
- Boot crash when SD card is absent but storage API is enabled
- App install stack overflow on ESP32-S3 (increased dedicated install thread stack)
- DRAM overflow on boards without PSRAM (reduced static allocations; fallback paths added)
- BT mode conflict when BLE and BT HID are active simultaneously
- Poll stack overflow under concurrent WiFi and web server traffic

---

### Security

#### Added
- **Capability Guard model** — every native API export guarded by `akira_security_check_exec()` with `AKIRA_CAP_*` bitmask; manifests declare required capabilities
- **SHA-256 binary integrity** — mbedTLS-backed hash verified before any WASM binary is loaded into the runtime
- **Ed25519 / RSA signature verification** — `src/runtime/security/app_signing_v2.c` validates app publisher signatures via mbedTLS
- **Runtime sandbox** — `sandbox.c` / `sandbox.h` enforce syscall filtering and per-app call rate limiting
- **Security audit log** — capability violations and sandbox events written to ring buffer for post-mortem inspection
- `security.c` / `security.h` — unified capability authority (replaces the two divergent `security.h` / `capability.h` files)

#### Fixed
- Multiple redundant `#define` declarations for capability constants across headers
- `AKIRA_CAP_*` symbols were declared in both `security.h` and `capability.h` — now single source of truth

---

### Connectivity

#### Added
- **Arduino-style BLE App API** — replaces raw `bt_shell`; full 12-function surface: `ble_init`, `ble_deinit`, `ble_set_local_name`, `ble_service_create`, `ble_char_create`, `ble_service_add_char`, `ble_add_service`, `ble_set_advertised_service`, `ble_advertise`, `ble_stop_advertise`, `ble_char_write`, `ble_event_pop` and more
- **BLE GATT service pool** — multi-service, multi-characteristic layout with CCC/notify plumbing; event queue (`K_MSGQ`) for async connect/disconnect/write events
- **BT HID WASM API** — hotkey scripting and custom key bindings from WASM apps (`bt_hid_send_key`, `bt_hid_send_media`)
- **USB HID mouse support** added alongside existing keyboard (`feat(usb_hid): added mouse to usb_hid`)
- **TCP/UDP WASM network API** — zero-copy ring-buffer shared-memory channel; `net_tcp_connect`, `net_tcp_send`, `net_udp_send`, `net_recv`
- **Shared HTTP upload buffer pool** — prevents fragmentation during concurrent OTA + web-server traffic
- Matter, Thread, and AkiraMesh connectivity layer scaffolding

#### Changed
- WiFi scan (`wifi_scan` shell command) now blocks for 5 s and prints results inline instead of to a background log
- HTTP web server refactored to callback-based transport layer; stack size increased
- USB HID manager ported to the new Zephyr USB stack

#### Fixed
- BLE HID iOS compatibility — corrected HID descriptor to separate keyboard from composite device mode
- BT HID report descriptor misalignment causing dropped keys
- Web server crash on first HTTP request after boot
- OTA partition layout — NVS/LFS partitions relocated above OTA region; stale boot counter healed on upgrade
- Net buffer exhaustion under concurrent WiFi + web server: `NET_PKT RX/TX` raised 8→12, `BUF_TX` raised 16→20

### Hardware & Board Support

#### Added
- **AkiraConsole** custom out-of-tree ESP32-S3 board — full HWMv2 definition: `boards/akiraconsole/` with `.dts`, pinctrl `.dtsi`, `.yaml`, `_defconfig`, `board.cmake`, `board.yml`, and per-board `.conf` / `.overlay`
- **ESP32-S3 Super Mini** out-of-tree board — HWMv2-compatible definition in `boards/esp32s3_super_mini/`
- **`akira,ili9341`** out-of-tree Zephyr display driver for AkiraConsole (`feat(display): add akira,ili9341 out-of-tree driver`)
- **LR1121 transceiver** RF framework driver with `SYS_INIT` auto-init hooks (`src/drivers/rf/`)
- **SD card** support — `sd_card.c` / `sd_card.h`; direct app install from SD; WASM storage API on top
- `boards/lr1121_template.overlay` — reference overlay for LR1121 radio integration
- `boards/nrf54l15dk_nrf54l15_cpuapp` board files added to overlay set

#### Changed
- ST7789V display integrated with Zephyr native driver and dynamic capability registration
- All board `.conf` / `.overlay` files refactored for strict modularity; board-specific settings removed from root `prj.conf`
- LSM6DS3 IMU driver moved to out-of-tree with generic sensor WASM API facade

#### Fixed
- STM32 B-U585I-IOT02A boot sequence; app image now signed for MCUBoot before flash
- ESP32-S3 Super Mini board definition updated for Zephyr 4.3 HWMv2 requirements
- ESP32 DevKitC board configs cleaned up; removed duplicated symbols
