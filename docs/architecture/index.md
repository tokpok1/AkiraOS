# Architecture Overview

AkiraOS employs a **layered modular architecture** designed for secure, high-performance WebAssembly execution on embedded systems.

## Architecture Layers

### [User Space](../api-reference)
WebAssembly applications run in isolated sandboxes with capability-based access control.

- **Execution:** WASM bytecode (interpreter) or AOT (native code)
- **Security:** Per-app capabilities, memory quotas
- **Size:** 50KB-200KB per app
- **Max Instances:** 8 installable apps, 2 concurrent running (configurable per board)
- **Performance:** 1x (interpreter) or 10-50x (AOT)

[Learn more about the Runtime →](runtime.md) | [AOT Compilation →](aot-compilation.md)

### [AkiraRuntime](runtime.md)
Custom WASM runtime managing application lifecycle, security, and native API bridging.

- **App Management:** Load, start, stop, unload
- **Security:** Inline capability checks (~60ns overhead, estimated)
- **Memory:** PSRAM allocation with per-app quotas
- **Native APIs:** 18 modules including BLE, Display, GPIO, HID, I2C, IPC (pub/sub), Lifecycle, Memory, Net (sockets), Power, PWM, RF, Sensor, Storage, Timer, UART, and common utilities (printf, delay)
- **UI Framework:** 32 widgets, 8 screens, touch support
- **Shell System:** System stats, command history, diagnostics

[Runtime Architecture Details →](runtime.md)

### [Connectivity Layer](connectivity.md)
Modular protocol stack for WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, and OTA operations.

- **Transport Interface:** Callback-based data routing
- **HTTP Server:** File uploads, OTA endpoints
- **Bluetooth:** BLE stack, HID support
- **OTA Manager:** MCUboot firmware updates
- **AkiraMesh:** Foundation mesh networking

[Connectivity Architecture Details →](connectivity.md)

### [Zephyr RTOS](https://docs.zephyrproject.org)
Real-time kernel providing threading, networking, drivers, and file system.

- **Scheduler:** Preemptive multitasking
- **Network Stack:** TCP/IP, BLE
- **Drivers:** SPI, I2C, UART, GPIO, flash
- **File System:** LittleFS on flash storage

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| App Manager | WASM app lifecycle | [Runtime](runtime.md) |
| Security Layer | Capability enforcement | [Security](security.md) |
| Native Bridge | WASM↔Native calls | [Runtime](runtime.md) |
| UI Framework | Widget-based display UI | [Runtime](runtime.md) |
| Shell System | System diagnostics/control | [Runtime](runtime.md) |
| Driver Registry | Dynamic driver lookup | `src/drivers/` |
| Settings Storage | NVS-backed configuration | `src/settings/` |
| Error Codes | Standardized error system | `src/lib/` |
| Transport Interface | Protocol routing | [Connectivity](connectivity.md) |
| OTA Manager | Firmware updates | [Connectivity](connectivity.md) |
| HTTP Server | Network API | [Connectivity](connectivity.md) |

## Data Flow

### Application Loading
```
Network → Transport Interface → App Loader → File System → Chunked Loader → WAMR → App Instance
```

### Firmware Update (OTA)
```
HTTP POST → OTA Manager → Flash Driver → MCUboot Secondary Slot → Reboot → Verify → Activate
```

### Native API Call
```
WASM Code → WAMR Import → Native Bridge → Inline Cap Check → HAL Function → Hardware
```

[Detailed Data Flow Diagrams →](data-flow.md)

## Design Principles

1. **Zero-Trust Execution** – All apps sandboxed with explicit capabilities
2. **Direct-to-Hardware** – Minimal abstraction layers for performance
3. **Modular Connectivity** – Pluggable transport protocols
4. **OTA-First** – Atomic updates with rollback protection
5. **Resource Efficient** – Supports devices from <1MB SRAM (native_sim) to 8MB PSRAM (ESP32-S3 boards)

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Native Call Overhead | ~60ns (estimated) | <50ns |
| WASM Load Time (100KB) | ~80ms (estimated) | <50ms |
| OTA Flash Write | ~200 KB/s | ~300 KB/s |
| HTTP Throughput | ~1.3 MB/s | ~2 MB/s |
| Memory Overhead | ~32KB | <24KB |

*Note: Performance metrics are board-dependent and represent estimates. Actual values vary by hardware configuration.*

[Performance Benchmarks →](../resources/performance.md)

## Security Model

- **Sandboxing:** WASM memory isolation
- **Capabilities:** Fine-grained permission bits
- **Quotas:** Per-app memory limits
- **Manifest:** Embedded capability declarations
- **Flash Protection:** Read-only app storage
