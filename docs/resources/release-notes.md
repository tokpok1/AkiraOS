# Release Notes

## v1.4.9 — "Gl1tch"

**Released:** March 2026
**Branch:** `v1.4.x` → `main` | **PR:** [#52](https://github.com/ArturR0k3r/AkiraOS/pull/52)

This release completes the v1.4.x generation of AkiraOS. It replaces the legacy OCRE runtime with WAMR, introduces the Capability Guard security model, ships the AkiraConsole custom board, adds a comprehensive suite of WASM peripheral APIs, and delivers the AkiraSDK as an independently versioned git submodule alongside a full documentation site.

---

### Runtime Engine

The core execution engine has been completely rewritten around **WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)**.

**What changed:**
- Full OCRE → WAMR migration with Zephyr 4.3.0 compatibility
- Thread-per-app model — each WASM app runs in its own Zephyr thread managed by `SYS_INIT`
- AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation enabled by default for native-speed execution and ~60 KB RAM savings per app slot compared to the interpreter
- Chunked WASM loading with PSRAM fallback on ESP32-S3
- Instance pool and SHA-256-keyed module cache eliminate redundant reloads
- Per-app execution watchdog with configurable timeout
- WASM apps now compile to bare `wasm32` — no WASI dependency

**Bug fixes:**
- WASM out-of-bounds memory trap on ESP32-S3
- App lifecycle freezes on repeated start/stop cycles
- Boot crash when SD card is absent but storage is enabled
- DRAM overflow on non-PSRAM boards

---

### Security Model

AkiraOS v1.4.9 introduces a formal **Capability Guard** security architecture.

Every native API export is guarded by `akira_security_check_exec()`. Apps declare required capabilities (`AKIRA_CAP_*` bitmasks) in their manifest JSON; the runtime enforces these at dispatch time.

Additional hardening:
- **SHA-256 binary integrity** — WASM binary hash verified before loading (mbedTLS)
- **Ed25519/RSA signature verification** — publisher signatures checked via mbedTLS (`app_signing_v2.c`)
- **Runtime sandbox** — syscall filtering and per-app call rate limiting (`sandbox.c`)
- **Security audit log** — ring-buffer log of capability violations for post-mortem analysis

For capability definitions see [Manifest Format](../api-reference/manifest-format.md) and [Native API Reference](../api-reference/native-api.md).

---

### Connectivity

#### BLE
The low-level `bt_shell` interface is replaced by a full **Arduino-style BLE App API** callable from WASM. Apps can create GATT services, register characteristics, advertise, read/write values, and receive connection events through a simple event queue.

Key functions: `ble_init`, `ble_service_create`, `ble_char_create`, `ble_advertise`, `ble_char_write`, `ble_event_pop`.

#### Bluetooth HID
Full BT HID WASM API for keyboard/media hotkey scripting from WASM apps. iOS compatibility fixed for BLE HID.

#### USB HID
Ported to the new Zephyr USB stack. Mouse device added alongside keyboard.

#### Network (TCP/UDP)
New zero-copy network API using shared-memory ring buffers. Functions: `net_tcp_connect`, `net_tcp_send`, `net_udp_send`, `net_recv`.

#### HTTP Web Server
- Crash on first request fixed
- Shared buffer pool added for upload operations
- Callback-based transport layer refactor

#### OTA
Partition layout corrected — NVS/LFS now reside above the OTA region, preventing partition overlap. Stale boot counter healed automatically on upgrade.
